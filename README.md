# ðŸ“Š Task 7: Basic Sales Summary Using Python + SQLite

## âœ… What I Did
- Created a small SQLite database `sales_data.db` with a `sales` table.
- Inserted sample sales data (product, quantity, price).
- Wrote a SQL query to calculate:
  - **Total quantity sold** per product
  - **Total revenue** (`SUM(quantity * price)`)
- Loaded results into **pandas DataFrame**.
- Printed the summary and plotted a **bar chart** using matplotlib.

## ðŸ“Š Outcome
- Learned how to connect Python with SQLite (`sqlite3`).
- Practiced writing **SQL inside Python**.
- Generated both **tabular output** and a **bar chart visualization** of revenue.
